## Software for the annual [Ironscout Event](https://www.scout-o-wiki.de/index.php/Ironscout)

Every year, the now legendary Ironscout takes place for rovers, leaders and employees of the German Scout Association of St. George (DPSG), the Association of Scouts and Guides (BdP), the Association of Christian Scouts (VCP) and the Girl Scout Association of St. George (PSG).
Based on the Ironman, the Ironscout is a 22-hour run. As a team, you have to find as many stations as possible at this time, using only a map and a compass, and you have to complete various tasks.
Points are awarded for completing the station tasks, which are then used to determine the winner of the running teams from all over Germany at the end of the run. In addition, the most creative and best station is rewarded for its work.
Recording and adding up the points for the big game is a challenge, as the data is often recorded incorrectly on paper and has to be compiled for evaluation, which is another source of error. In addition, there is enormous time pressure immediately after the end of the game, as the award ceremony takes place a few hours after the end.
